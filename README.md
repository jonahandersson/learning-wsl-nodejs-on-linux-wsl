# Learning WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) on NodeJS Express Example 

# What is WSL? 

The Windows Subsystem for Linux lets developers run a GNU/Linux environment -- including most command-line tools, utilities, and applications -- directly on Windows, unmodified, without the overhead of a traditional virtual machine or dualboot setup.

You can:

* Choose your favorite GNU/Linux distributions from the Microsoft Store.
*  Run common command-line tools such as grep, sed, awk, or other ELF-64 binaries.
*  Run Bash shell scripts and GNU/Linux command-line applications including:
*  Tools: vim, emacs, tmux
*  Languages: NodeJS, Javascript, Python, Ruby, C/C++, C# & F#, Rust, Go, etc.
*  Services: SSHD, MySQL, Apache, lighttpd, MongoDB, PostgreSQL.
*  Install additional software using your own GNU/Linux distribution package manager.
*  Invoke Windows applications using a Unix-like command-line shell.
*  Invoke GNU/Linux applications on Windows.
